This directory contains some of my commonly used C utilities centralized for easy sharing among different code bases. Contains:

- Generic FIFO implementation

- Generic list implementation

- Useful macros

To build release shared library and create `relase` directory containing a 
copy of all headers :

```bash
make release
```
